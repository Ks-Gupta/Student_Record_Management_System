## 🎓 Student Record Management System

A simple **CLI-based CRUD application** written in Java that allows users to manage student records efficiently.
The system lets you **add**, **view**, **update**, and **delete** student information directly from the console.

---

### 📋 Objective

To build a **command-line Java program** that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and CRUD operations using an `ArrayList`.

---

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **Programming Language:** Java
* **IDE:** VS Code 
* **Collections Used:** ArrayList
* **Concepts Used:** OOP, Scanner, switch-case, Iterators

### 🧠 Concepts Implemented

* **Class and Object** → Represent students as objects
* **ArrayList** → Store and manage multiple records dynamically
* **Encapsulation** → Use getters and setters to access private fields
* **Switch-case & Loops** → Handle user menu selections
* **Exception Safety** → Use `Scanner` input handling

---

### 🚧 Future Enhancements

* Store student records in a file or database
* Add search functionality by name or marks
* Validate inputs for marks and IDs
* Create a GUI version using JavaFX or Swing
